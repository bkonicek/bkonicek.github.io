I'm starting this blog to document my learning journey going forward. 

<!-- This is my first blog post and fair warning - it'll probably be pretty long and rambling as I figure out how I want to structure this.

I've been working with Kubernetes more and more at work and wanted a cluster of my own to experiment with different tools and services. In the past I've set up various clusters either on my personal desktop or on a spare computer I had lying around, but for a number of reasons it was never an idea experience for me.

I've never been one to have a massive homelab with loud, power hungry servers running 24/7. I don't really have an ideal space for them in my house, not to mention the power bill. I also don't like the idea of exposing services running out of my house to the public internet, no matter how much work I put into securing it. 

Running Kubernetes on a workstation (via Docker Desktop or Virtual Machines) is nice for quickly testing something out, but it doesn't really lend itself to services that you'd actually like to keep running all the time. There are also usually some hacky workarounds for access services running within those clusters.

Sure, I could spin up a managed Kubernetes cluster in AWS, Azure, or GCP, but I'm cheap and those get expensive fast.

Enter Oracle Cloud - they're not exactly winning the cloud wars, but they're very generous with the list of "Always Free" resources they provide.

I was pretty skeptical that I could actually run a cloud-managed Kubernetes cluster with 24GB of RAM for absolutely nothing but had to give it a try.

As I found out, this was pretty much true - however there are some caveats. Due to the limitations of the Always Free offerings, I had to get creative with some of the extra components I needed for my cluster. Since the 200GB of free block storage are limited to 2 volumes, I could quickly start getting charged money if I used the default StorageClass that OKE comes with. Luckily, they also give you 2 x86 VMs, so I planned to just attach the full 200GB to one of the x86 instances and configure an NFS server on it.
