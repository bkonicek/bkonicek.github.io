I've been working in Tech in some form or another since 2014 when I got my start as a Systems Administrator. I started learning about Cloud and DevOps technologies on my own and was immediately excited by their possibilities for solving interesting technical problems. I've worked in a wide variety of industries including non-profit, venture capital, cloud consulting, online sportsbetting, and consumer startups.

When I'm not working or playing with technology I enjoy traveling, cooking, getting outdoors with my wife and our dog, playing video games, and checking out breweries wherever I happen to be.
