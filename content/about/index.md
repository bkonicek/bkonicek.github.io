I've been working in IT in some form or another since 2014. I got my start primarily as a Windows Systems Administrator in typical office environments. I started learning about Cloud and DevOps technologies on my own and was immediately excited by their possibilities for solving interesting problems. I've worked in a wide variety of industries including non-profit, venture capital, cloud consulting, and online betting and love learning how these different types of businesses face a variety of challenges.

When I'm not working or playing with tech I enjoy traveling, cooking, getting outdoors with my wife and our dog, playing video games, and checking out breweries wherever I happen to be.
